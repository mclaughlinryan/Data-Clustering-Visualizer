# Data-Clustering-Visualizer

This is a graphical user interface application that allows the user to visualize the clustering of data through selection from several different clustering algorithms and side-by-side comparison of different clusterings.

The file containing the data must have data points with the same set of features and the features must be comma separated. The data points could also have classifications already assigned to them as the last value in the file line.
