# Data-Clustering-Visualizer

This is a graphical user interface application that allows the user to visualize the clustering of data through selection from several different clustering algorithms as well as side-by-side comparison of different data clusterings.

#### Data File Format

The file containing the data must have data points with the same set of features and the features must be comma separated. The data points could also have classifications assigned to them as the last value in the file line.
