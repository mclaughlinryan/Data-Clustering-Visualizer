# Data-Clustering-Visualizer

This is a graphical user interface application that allows the user to visualize the clustering of data from a file.

#### Data File Format

The file containing the data must contain data points that have the same set of features and that the features are comma separated. The data points could also have classifications already assigned to them as the last value in the file line.
