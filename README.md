# Data-Clustering-Visualizer

This is a graphical user interface application that allows the user to visualize the clustering of data through selection from several different clustering algorithms and side-by-side comparison of different clusterings.

#### Data File Format

For the data file to be processed by the program, the file must contain data points that have the same set of features and that the features are comma separated. The data points could also have classifications already assigned to them as the last value in the file line.
